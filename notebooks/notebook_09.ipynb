    "On Earth, the classical problem of earthquake hypocenter location is solved using triangulation, which requires a network of seismic instruments. Based on the time it takes for waves to reach different seismic stations, an earthquake location can be determined, provided a seismic velocity model. On Mars, we only have a single seismometer, so we can not use triangulation. Instead, we need to make use of knowledge on the *polarization* of seismic waves, along with apriori models of the subsurface velocities in the crust and mantle.\n",

SEIS data from InSight can be accessed through Obspy's IRIS client, just like you have been using for Earth data!

    "The data you raw data that you downloaded needs some processing before we can make any sense of it. First, the data is still in raw 'counts', so we need to remove the instrument response to get the data into units of real ground motion. Also, the channels that you downloaded (BHU,BHV,BHW) are not in the correct coordinate system. We need to rotate the data to get to the Z, N, and E components we are used to dealing with. Above, the function `remove_response_and_rotate_to_zne` is provided to process the raw SEIS data and convert to velocity in Z,N, and E directions. After removing the instrument response and rotating to ZNE, the marsquake signal will still not look very clear. This is because the noise levels at long period are relatively high, so the marsquake signals appear to ride on longer period energy. The dominant energy of S0235b is between roughly 2 - 8 s. \n",

    "Once the epicentral distance has been determined, the next step is to determine the direction from the station to the marsquake (called the 'back azimuth'). One method for calculating the back azimuth is to try different rotation angles, and determine which one maximizes the P-wave energy on the radial component. This approach is based on the fact that the P-wave is polarized in the plane that connects the source and receiver. However, there are two possible rotation angles (180-degrees apart) that will maximimize the P-wave energy on the radial component. To resolve this 180-degree ambiguity, we can recognize that the rotation angle that corresponds to the correct back azimuth will give a positive correlation between the vertical and radial components. Below, a 'psuedocode' for how this algorithm works is provided.\n",
